Adanaxis 'spaces' directory
===========================

It is possible to use new mods/levels/spaces by dragging their directories into
this one.  However the script files in those directories will have full access
to your system (to delete and remove files, etc.) so make sure that they come
from a trusted source.  The win32 and X11 uninstallation process won't remove
the new directories.

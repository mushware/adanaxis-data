Adanaxis Data
=============

This is the data repo for the Adanaxis project.  Most of the content is under
an MIT-style licence (see COPYING) but it does contain content from other
sources.  These are:

| File               | Content              | Licence                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| mush/pixels.mush   | Explosion animations | Licenced from Artbeats (https://www.artbeats.com/)                       |
| mush/voice-\*.mush | Voice samples        | Copyright Linda Bard (http://www.studiobard.com/), licenced for Adanaxis |
| mush/waves.mush    | Audio samples        | Licenced from SoundDogs.com (https://www.sounddogs.com/)                 |
| pixels/cosmos/\*   | Space images         | 'NASA still images' or 'HST publicly released images'                    |

However the game will run without the .mush files and uses substitutes also
present in this repo, should a freely licenced alternative be required.
